# Breadth First Search (BFS)

- One common application of Breadth-first Search (BFS) is to find the shortest path from the root node to the target node. BFS of a graph is similar to BFS of a tree. The only catch is, unlike tree, graphs may contain cycles. so we may come to th same node.To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.

- If a node X is added to the queue in the kth round, the length of the shortest path between the root node and X is exactly k. That is to say, you are already in the shortest path the first time you find the target node.
- The time complexity in a graph is O(V+E), where V: number of vertices and E: number of edges.

```py
# BFS algorithm in Python
import collections

def bfs(graph, root):
    queue = collections.deque([root])
    visited = set()
    depth = -1
    
    while queue:
        size = len(queue)
        depth += 1
        
        for _ in range(size):
            cur = queue.popleft()
            if cur in visited: continue
            visited.add(cur)
            queue.extend(nextLayer(node))
        
def nextLayer(node):
    listNodes = []
    // add all successors of node to listNodes
    return listNodes
    
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [1, 2]}
    print("Following is Breadth First Traversal: ")
    bfs(graph, 0)
```

# Depth First Search (DFS)

- We don't know if the found path is the shortest path between two vertices.
- Instead of queue in BFS, we use stack (LIFO) in DFS.
- The average time complexity for DFS on a graph is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is O(V), where V is the number of nodes.
- We say average time complexity because a setâ€™s `in` operation has an average time complexity of O(1). If we used a list, the complexity would be higher.
- What if you want to find the shortest path?
Hint: Add one more parameter to indicate the shortest path you have already found.

```py
visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes.
def dfs(visited, graph, node):
    if node not in visited:
        print (node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)
```
