# Breadth First Search (BFS)

- One common application of Breadth-first Search (BFS) is to find the shortest path from the root node to the target node. BFS of a graph is similar to BFS of a tree. The only catch is, unlike tree, graphs may contain cycles. so we may come to th same node.To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array.

- If a node X is added to the queue in the kth round, the length of the shortest path between the root node and X is exactly k. That is to say, you are already in the shortest path the first time you find the target node.
- The time complexity in a graph is O(V+E), where V: number of vertices and E: number of edges.

```py
# BFS algorithm in Python
import collections

def bfs(graph, root):
    queue = collections.deque([root])
    visited = set()
    depth = -1
    
    while queue:
        size = len(queue)
        depth += 1
        
        for _ in range(size):
            cur = queue.popleft()
            if cur in visited: continue
            visited.add(cur)
            queue.extend(nextLayer(node))
        
def nextLayer(node):
    listNodes = []
    // add all successors of node to listNodes
    return listNodes
    
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [1, 2]}
    print("Following is Breadth First Traversal: ")
    bfs(graph, 0)
```

# Depth First Search (DFS)

- We don't know if the found path is the shortest path between two vertices.
- Instead of queue in BFS, we use stack (LIFO) in DFS.
- The average time complexity for DFS on a graph is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is O(V), where V is the number of nodes.
- We say average time complexity because a setâ€™s `in` operation has an average time complexity of O(1). If we used a list, the complexity would be higher.
- What if you want to find the shortest path?
Hint: Add one more parameter to indicate the shortest path you have already found.

```py
visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes.
def dfs(visited, graph, node):
    if node not in visited:
        print (node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)
```

```py
# DFS algorithm
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)

    print(start)

    for next in graph[start] - visited:
        dfs(graph, next, visited)
    return visited


graph = {'0': set(['1', '2']),
         '1': set(['0', '3', '4']),
         '2': set(['0']),
         '3': set(['1']),
         '4': set(['2', '3'])}

dfs(graph, '0')

## Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
# Example:
# Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6

- The brute force solution: for each location, find the max on the left and max on the right of that location and take the min of them
- Optimal solution: calculate the column of water in each location based on the followings:
    - If there was an infinite tall wall on the right end of the array, the water in each location would be the height of max so far on the left of the location - height of the location
    - Now for the locations on the right of the infinite wall, the water in each location coming from right to left is heigth of max so far on the right of the location - height of location.

## Longest consecutive sequence:
- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
- **solutions:**
- **1. Brute force**:
- it just considers each number in nums, attempting to count as high as possible from that number using only numbers in nums. After it counts too high (i.e. currentNum refers to a number that nums does not contain), it records the length of the sequence if it is larger than the current best. The algorithm is necessarily optimal because it explores every possibility.
```py
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    longest = 0
    for num in nums:
        curr = num
        local_streak = 1
        
        while curr + 1 in nums:
            local_streak += 1
            curr += 1
        
        longest = max(longest, local_streak)
    return longest
```
- **Time complexity**: O(n^3) - the for loop: n, the while loop is n and the `in` operator in `while` is O(n)..
- **Space complexity** O(1).

**2. Define nums as a set so we do lookup in in O(1) time:**
- First turn the input into a set of numbers. That takes O(n) and then we can ask in O(1) whether we have a certain number. Then go through the numbers. If the number x is the start of a streak (i.e., x-1 is not in the set), then test y = x+1, x+2, x+3, ... and stop at the first number y not in the set. The length of the streak is then simply y-x and we update our global best with that. Since we check each streak only once, this is overall **O(n)**.
```py
def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums = set(nums)
        result = 0
        
        for x in nums:
            if x - 1 not in nums:
                y = x + 1
                while y in nums:
                    y += 1
                result = max(result, y - x)
        return result
```
