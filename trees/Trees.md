**Tree**

- Linear data structures like as arrays, linked lists, queues and stack, data is ordered and you traverse them sequentially (pic: https://medium.com/basecs/how-to-not-be-stumped-by-trees-5f36208f68a7)
- Non-linear data structure can be trees and the data traversal is not sequential. Trees are made of nodes, links. A root, parent nodes, sibling nodes (the same parent), inner nodes, leaf nodes.
- **Depth** of a node: how many edges from the node to the root 
- **Height** of a node: the maximum path from the node to the furthest leaf node
- so the height of the root is the height of the tree.
- trees are recursive data structures, a tree has a nested subtrees.
- **balanced trees**: if any two **sibling subtree** do not differ in the height by more than one level.(otherwise it will be an unbalanced tree)
- filesystems are trees
