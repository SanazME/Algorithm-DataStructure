Solution: We can think of the symmetric input matrix as an **undirected graph**.  We can treat our input matrix as an **adjacency matrix**; our task is to find the number of connected components.

Solution: [Number of islands](https://github.com/SanazME/Algorithm-DataStructure/blob/master/AmazonQuestions.md#5-number-of-islands)
- Time complexity:
  - DFS, BFS: `O(N*M)` N: rows, M; columns
- Space complexity: 
  - DFS: O(N*M)
  - BFS: O(min(N,M))
