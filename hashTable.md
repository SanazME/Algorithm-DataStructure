- Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using **hash functions** in order to support quick insertion and search.
- The key idea of Hash Table is to use a hash function to **map keys to buckets**. To be more specific,
  - When we insert a new key, the hash function will decide which bucket the key should be assigned and the key will be stored in the corresponding bucket;
  - When we want to search for a key, the hash table will use the **same hash function** to find the corresponding bucket and search only in the specific bucket.
